# Typing Trainer

Typing Trainer is a little tool that has you do some touch typing, then tells you which letters you should work on.

It's built with TS and SCSS from the `src` directory, which compile to the JS and CSS files found at `/`.

To run:

- `npm i`
- `npm run start`
- the script lives in `/src/script.ts`, which is compiled to `/script.js`
- the styles live in `/src/stylesheet.scss`, which is compiled to `/stylesheet.js`
